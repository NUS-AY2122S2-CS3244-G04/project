"The SDP pushed for reform of the immigration policy which it says allows in too many foreign workers into Singapore to displace local PMETs.
The party made this proposal when it launched its alternative population and immigration policy Building A People: Sound Policies For A Secure Future at its office in Ang Mo Kio this afternoon.
The proposals, introduced by a new face in the party Ms Joyce Tan, would take a more measured approach towards allowing foreigners to work in Singapore.
One idea is to adopt a points-based system called the Talent Track Scheme where foreign PMETS wishing to work in Singapore have to apply to. The applications will be assessed based on their qualifications, skills, and experience.
Only those who meet the required number of points will qualify for a list of potential employees.
Employers will then be allowed to hire foreigners from this pool but will have to demonstrate that no Singaporean is available or qualifies for the position before that.
“This will prevent firms hiring foreigners based solely on their ability to accept lower wages,” said Ms Tan, a communications professional who has held executive positions in local and international corporations. She currently works in a regional company.
The SDP’s proposal comes amidst a rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched. Such a trend is partly the result of hundreds of local companies continuing to discriminate against local workers.
Ms Tan also took issue with the idea that Singapore can accommodate a 10 million population. The idea was raised by Mr Heng Swee Keat recently.
With a population density that is one of the highest in the world, Singapore can ill-afford to grow a population of 10 million by bringing in more foreigners.
As it is, Singaporeans are one of the unhappiest and most stressed out workers in the world. By not taking into consideration the physical and mental well-being of the people, the PAP’s current approach of cramming more foreigners onto this island is counter-productive.
CEC member Mr Khung Wai Yeen, who presented the policy with Ms Tan, pointed this out. He also noted the low birthrate and high emigration rate that is causing the Singaporean population to shrink.
He cited the high cost of living and stressful lifestyle as causes of younger Singaporeans leaving the country or having fewer children.
To address this problem, the SDP has proposed a 10-point plan under another policy A Better Life For All: Keeping The Cost Of Living In Singapore Affordable to make Singapore less expensive.
“Raising taxes and fees on a slew of items in the last couple of years makes Singapore even more expensive and, hence, exacerbates the problem of a shrinking population,” Ms Tan pointed out. “This is why the raising of the GST to 9 percent from the current 7 percent is a bad idea.”
One suggestion in the proposal is to abolish the GST for basic necessities like food, medicine and school supplies.
It points out that the intent of the PAP is to increase GDP growth at all cost, adding that it is misguided for the Government to think that having a larger population, even one made up of a disproportionate number of foreigners, will achieve this goal.
A large population, the SDP says, achieved at the expense of the well-being of Singaporeans is a recipe for disaster. Not only does it hurt the people but it will make Singaporeans even more alienated and disengaged from society.
The party has therefore proposed using the Genuine Progress Index (GPI) which measures economic progress by also taking into consideration social and environmental factors.
The alternative also proposes the removal of race identity in our Identity Cards as this serves only to divide Singaporeans when we should be fostering one single Singaporean identity.
The SDP has previously launched other alternative policies in housing and healthcare.",1

"Extremely disturbing allegations in this press statement. Information related to the use of the death penalty is difficult to get from the Singapore Prison Service or the Ministry of Home Affairs, but this is a huge matter that needs to be addressed. And there should be more openness and transparency about how capital punishment is administered in Singapore in general. 
“We received this information from a Singapore Prison Services (SPS) officer who had served at the execution chamber in Changi prison, and himself carried out hangings.
This officer is prepared to come forward and testify at the appropriate forum. His evidence follows below:
He and other prison officers were instructed to carry out the following brutal procedure whenever the rope breaks during a hanging, which happens from time to time.
a) The prison officer is instructed to pull the rope around the neck of the prisoner towards him.
b) Meanwhile, another prison officer will apply pressure by pulling the body in the opposite direction.
c) The first officer must then kick the back of the neck of the prisoner with great force in order to break it.
d) The officers are told to kick the back of the neck because that would be consistent with death by hanging.
e) The officers are told not to kick more than 2 times, so that there will be no tell-tale marks in case there is an autopsy.
f) Strict orders are also given not to divulge the above to other prison staff not involved in executions.
We have been informed that prison officers were given special training to carry out the above brutal execution method.”",1
"Singaporean executors kick and pull on inmates condemned to death by hanging to effectively kill them, Lawyers for Liberty alleged today when warning that Malaysian convicts there were at risk of the cruel punishment.
The rights group representing Malaysians sentenced to die in Singapore further alleged that it has eye-witness testimony from a Singaporean prison official who was willing to testify to this in an “appropriate forum”.
LFL adviser N. Surendran said his group was compelled to release these allegations today after the republic ignored attempts to raise such matters with the country’s officials.
Among others, he said the witness informed LFL that Singapore made its prison officers simultaneously yank on the rope by which condemned inmates are hanged while pulling down on their bodies.
This was compounded by forcibly kicking the back of the inmates’ necks to simulate hanging injuries.
The method is purportedly to ensure the hanging results in a broken spinal cord that would effectively result in death, Surendran said in a statement today that further asserted that such methods were specially taught to Singapore’s prison officials.
“This execution method is unlawful as the mode of execution prescribed by law is hanging by the neck, and not execution by brutal kicking of the neck.
“Every death row prisoner in Changi, including the Malaysians, is in danger of suffering this excruciating death, should the rope break during the hanging,” Surendran said.
Surendran added that executors were also told not to kick more than twice in order to avoid suspicious markings on the condemned inmates’ bodies and ordered not to discuss the alleged methods.
Such techniques were deceptive, unlawful, and in clear violation of Singapore’s constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishments, he said.
The lawyer was also adamant that the alleged execution techniques were known to Singaporean officials including its home minister.
He clarified, however, that LFL did not know for certain how many Malaysians might have experienced such treatment when they were executed in Singapore.
The former Padang Serai MP then demanded Singapore halt further executions while it addresses these allegations and arranges to compensate the families of any who were killed in this alleged fashion.
“We further call upon the Malaysian government to take urgent steps to protect the safety and basic rights of all Malaysian prisoners now on death row in Singapore.”
LFL first alluded to these claims in November, after Singapore proceeded with the execution of Malaysian drug mule Abd Helmi Ab Halim for trafficking 16g of heroin.
Surendran and his group had represented Abd Helmi and clashed repeatedly with Singapore in their bid to prevent the execution.",1
"A single mother with six school-going children was evicted from her rental flat because of her inability to pay the rent.
Sharing her story and lending her assistance was socio-political activist Gilbert Goh, who visited her.
In replying to TISG’s queries, Mr Goh said that the woman, Lina, had six children aged as follows:14 years, 12 years, 9 years, 8 years, 5 years and 2 months.
Speaking to Mr Goh, she said, “We have been kicked out from our rental flat due to outstanding rental default. As for now we have been staying at my sister’s house”.
He added that she has just started work and has applied for ComCare Assistance from the Ministry of Social and Family Development.
However, she asked for assistance with food rations.
According to Mr Goh, the 32-year-old single-mother had used her savings to top-up her children’s EZ-Link cards for them to take the bus.
She said, “I dun have any savings to top up their ezlink card any more. Can you help my kids top up their ezlink as study is important?”
“My 2-month-old baby is also low on milk – she drinks milk soya not normal milk formula”, Lina added.
Mr Goh told TISG that after her husband left, “We have helped her before, a few years back, with the same situation. We also repainted her home and someone built a cabinet for her – but now she has lost her home. It looks like her situation is regressing”.
“We just hope that the assistance provided is more targeted as a huge family has been tough for her to manage”, he added.
Mr Goh and his team gave the woman a small ‘angpao’, as well as S$50 in supermarket vouchers. They also received groceries and food supplies from an anonymous donor.",1
"Under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), the definition of “false” means that “even if one bit is found to be wrong or misleading, the whole statement can be considered false.

"Could the ministerial committee in charge of tackling COVID-19 have lost their focus on public health and started thinking about the election in March? Infectious diseases expert and Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Paul Tambyah suggested this possibility at a forum on Friday night (Jul 3).
Dr Tambyah was sharing his views at the National University of Singapore Society (NUSS) Pre-General Election Forum 2020.
The forum, held in collaboration with Mothership, was moderated by former nominated Member of Parliament (MP) Viswa Sadasivan. Other speakers included were People's Power Party's Goh Meng Seng, Singapore Democratic Alliance's Harminder Pal Singh, Reform Party's Charles Yeo, Progress Singapore Party's Francis Yuen and Red Dot United's Michelle Lee.
Dr Tambyah, who was recently elected to be the president of the US-based International Society of Infectious Diseases (ISID), praised Singapore's initial handling of the pandemic, saying that he had given comments to CNA in January on the issue.
""I think it was widely acknowledged in January and February, Singapore handled the pandemic really well. We followed the basic principles of public health. You identify all cases, you identify their contacts, you do extensive testing, you quarantine the contacts, you isolate, identify and you prevent chains of transmission from occurring,"" he said. 
In February, Dr Tambyah said there was a cluster of COVID-19 cases involving Bangladeshi workers at the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site, and this was also ""handled really well"", with identification of contacts, quarantine, and testing. 
""And then what happened was the employers started thinking, 'hey my workers are living in the same dormitory maybe you should bring them for testing'. 
""And then what happened was Ministry of Manpower issued a statement telling the employers they were not allowed to bring their workers for testing, and if they brought their workers for testing, they would lose their work pass privileges,"" said Dr Tambyah. 
He said that ""all hell broke loose"" in March, with people returning from the United States and Italy, and outbreaks in the dormitories. 
""I have an opinion as to why that happened, I don't know for sure. But you know that was the time they started talking about an early election. And you wonder whether the ministerial committee lost their focus on the public health and started thinking about the election,"" he said. 
""Like even today, we've got this cluster of cases in Tampines. And the head of the ministerial committee has to go to Marsiling to explain to people why they should vote for PAP even though Madam Halimah abandoned the constituents there,"" said Dr Tambyah. 
""He should be there in Tampines trying to sort out what's going on with the outbreak. So it's a huge distraction and we've argued that for a long time - that this distraction has actually hampered what was really going well, has just gone south.""
Dr Tambyah stressed that this has got ""nothing to do with the public health officials who are excellent professionals - the scientists, the nurses, the doctors"".
""A lot of this could have been done better and the consequences are devastating. We've got ... 44,000 people infected and they are invisible to the majority of Singaporeans but these are real people,"" he added.
Other topics discussed at the forum, which lasted more than two hours, included what the opposition candidates can offer and how they need to be in Parliament to deny the incumbent ""a blank cheque"".
SDA's chief media officer Mr Singh said he felt it was ""totally irresponsible"" for the PAP to have called an election at this time, but ""what is done is done"".
""And it is done because they have been unilaterally making decisions and being given a free cheque to make a decision, a blank cheque if I can use the word, and that's one of the main reasons ... that we need to see a more variety of colours in Parliament. We need to have the alternative parties, the opposition parties coming in because they have had a blank cheque for too long a period,"" said Mr Singh.
Reform Party's Mr Yeo urged electors to vote for ""each and every opposition party"", saying that ""political fragmentation"" is in the interest of Singaporeans.
All the political parties were invited to Friday's forum, but the People's Action Party, National Solidarity Party, Peoples Voice, Singapore People's Party and Workers' Party either declined or did not reply to the invite, said moderator Mr Sadasivan.

"Consolidating the issue of a doctor who got stroke after taking the Pfizer Vaccine. 
I reiterate that it is in public interests to make known that there is such potential risk of getting stroke for taking the Pfizer vaccine. It was well reported in places like HK on various incidents even though the authorities as well as Pfizer will always make that half- baked  statement that there is no evidence to show causal relationship between Pfizer vaccine and many of its suspected serious side effects including deaths. 
People thought Bell's Patsy Syndrome is the worse adverse side effects one could have for Covid19 vaccines but this is really an understatement. Suspected adverse side effects are far wider than that. 
With due consideration to the Doctor and the family, I have edited out the name mentioned without losing the gist of the matter. Please refrain from mentioning the Doctor's name in the comment section else your comment will be removed without prior notice.

Warning against the Pfizer vaccine. 
I am numbed, heart broken, but in prayers for *my cousin, Dr. XXX, an internationally celebrated gynecologist and fertility specialist with her practice in Singapore* and who brought her expertise to the other places of the world with mission to deliver hope and happiness here, there and everywhere. She is vivacious, gracious, beautiful and kind, a *devoted mother of three* . All this shattered for her, for us, for only a week or so after her taking the *Pfizer BioNtech shot* , she suffered a *brain haemorrhage* , thus joining the casualty list to this *problematic vaccine* that stands to make the parent company around US$35 billion for this year alone, a bonanza that this Big Pharma group plans to repeat upon an annual basis. 
Pfizer will of course try to exonerate but cannot extricate itself from the *scandal* which the Western corrupt and complicit media will *continue to conceal or explain away the extent of the risks* that the shots entail and mitigate the bad publicity by insisting that there is no direct proof between the sudden collapse of relatively young and previously healthy physicians -- as *XXX's case is no longer unique.* 
That *the company CEO, Albert Bourla, declined to take the jab,* as a morale booster if nothing else, says volumes about the efficacy and reliability of the product which in essence is *genetic manipulation.* 
Now the European Union has proposed a vaccination passport that may not recognize other types of shots -- from Cuba, Russia and China -- is proof in of itself of the ploy to create immunization apartheid and compell hesitant candidates to subject themselves to a shortlist of western and still *dubious injections.* 
In the meantime I weep for Dr. XXX and remember her seating on my side in the clan banquet about 14 months ago as we exchanged news about the children and their careers. 
Missing you, XXX, so dearly.",1
"A photo posted by a Facebook user, Jasmine Ng Lz, stated that her father had allegedly died after taking the vaccine.
The 81-year-old man was described by her daughter as healthy, strong and had no major sickness prior to his vaccination, had passed away from alleged vaccination complications.
The old man cycled to and from a polyclinic near his home for his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 6th April at about 8.30am.
He then went home and had his meal.
However, that very same day, at about 9pm, he allegedly became out of breath, breaking out in cold sweat and turned pale.
His daughter immediately called an ambulance and he was rushed to the hospital.
The old man was immediately attended to at the A&E, and after an hour or so, the doctor came out and said that he had a heart attack and his heart had stopped beating.
The doctors then tried to revive him but it was to no avail.

"""Rule of law is a concept for lawyers, but it doesn't operate in the real world,"" K Shanmugam, Law Minister",1
"When two great minds come to similar conclusions about the current global push to vaccinate everyone with the COVID experimental vaccines, we should pay close attention. Both highly experienced scientists have a totally negative view of the vaccination effort. Worse than being ineffective, they point to negative health outcomes for the global population. These two truth-telling acclaimed medical researchers make Fauci look as inept, deceitful and dangerous as he is.
The point made in this article is not only has Fauci pushed the wrong potentially disastrous pandemic solution, he has blocked the right one.
Much of what the two virologists say is very technical in nature. This article simplifies their controversial messages without losing their essential meanings. The public needs to understand their warnings that refute all the propaganda pushing vaccines from government and public health agencies as well as big media.
Warning: Keep reading and you may become depressed.
First considered is the thinking of Dr. Luc Montagnier, a French virologist and recipient of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He has a doctorate in medicine. But there is a lot more to conclude he is a great expert: He has received more than 20 major awards, including the French National Order of Merit and the Légion d'honneur. He is a recipient of the Lasker Award, the Scheele Award, the Louis-Jeantet Prize for medicine , the Gairdner Award the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, King Faisal International Prize (known as the Arab Nobel Prize), and the Prince of Asturias Award.
He has worked hard to expose the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccines, still experimental but sadly may soon be fully approved. The vaccines don't stop the virus, argues the prominent virologist, they do the opposite - they ""feed the virus,"" and facilitate its development into stronger and more transmittable variants. These new virus variants will be more resistant to vaccination and may cause more health implications than their ""original"" versions.
Montagnier refers to the mass vaccine program as an ""unacceptable mistake"" and are a ""scientific error as well as a medical error."" His assertion is that ""The history books will show that...it is the vaccination that is creating the variants."" In other words: ""There are antibodies, created by the vaccine,"" forcing the virus to ""find another solution"" or die. ""This is where the variants are created. It is the variants that ""are a production and result from the vaccination."" Stop and think about these thoughts. Have you heard a better explanation of variant creation? I doubt it.
He is talking about the mutation and strengthening of the virus from a phenomenon known as Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE). ADE is a mechanism that increases the ability of a virus to enter cells and cause a worsening of the disease.
Data from around the world confirms ADE occurs in SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, says Montagnier. ""You see it in each country, it's the same: the curve of vaccination is followed by the curve of deaths."" Sounds like what we are now hearing more about, namely escalating breakthrough infections that kill some people. And this spiral into disaster may have no end.
In a November 2020 documentary he emphasized harmful and irrational mask mandates as well as lockdowns, quarantines, abuses of government overreach, and supported use of effective COVID treatments such as hydroxychloroquine. The film was banned by YouTube and most other mainstream outlets. At that time Fauci had succeeded in blocking wide use of the cheap generic based treatments for COVID and pursued the wait for the vaccine strategy.
Montagnier has been a vocal critic of the mass vaccination campaign. In a letter to the President and Judges of the Supreme Court of the State of Israel, which unrolled the world's speediest and the most massive vaccination campaign, Montagnier argued for its suspension. He said: ""I would like to summarize the potential dangers of these vaccines in a mass vaccination policy."" Here they are:
1. Short-term side effects: these are not the normal local reactions found for any vaccination, but serious reactions involve the life of the recipient such as anaphylactic shock linked to a component of the vaccine mixture, or severe allergies or an autoimmune reaction up to cell aplasia. In this group we should include a number of lethal blood problems involving clots and loss of platelets that cause strokes, brain bleeds and other impacts.
Lack of vaccine protection:
2.1 In induced antibodies do not neutralize a viral infection, but on the contrary facilitate it depending on the recipient. The latter may have already been exposed to the virus asymptomatically. Naturally induced antibodies may compete with the antibodies induced by the vaccine.
2.2 The production of antibodies induced by vaccination in a population highly exposed to the virus will lead to the selection of variants resistant to these antibodies. These variants can be more virulent or more transmissible. This is what we are seeing now. An endless virus-vaccine race that will always turn to the advantage for the virus.
Long-term effects: Contrary to the claims of the manufacturers of messenger RNA vaccines, there is a risk of integration of viral RNA into the human genome. Our cells have the ability to reverse transcriptase from RNA into DNA. Although this is a rare event, its passage through the DNA of germ cells and its transmission to future generations cannot be excluded.
His bottom line: ""Faced with an unpredictable future, it is better to abstain."" But most people will find it extremely difficult to resist all the coercion and vaccine mandates.
Back in April 2020, before all the talk of variants and before the rollout of the experimental vaccines, Montagnier urged people to refuse vaccines against COVID-19 when they become available. His main point should always be remembered: ""instead of preventing the infection, they [would] accelerate infection."" Today, the newly occurring variants of SARS-CoV-2 that affect vaccinated people prove his thesis. With his scientific thinking, mass vaccination may cause a new, more deadly wave of pandemic infection.
As to the much talked about and hope for herd immunity, he has said: ""the vaccines Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca do not prevent the transmission of the virus person-to-person and the vaccinated are just as transmissive as the unvaccinated. Therefore the hope of a 'collective immunity' by an increase in the number of vaccinated is totally futile.""
On the positive side, he advocated this: ""The early treatment of infection with ivermectin and bacterial antibiotic because there is a bacterial cofactor that amplifies the effects of the virus. ""
The stark views of Montagnier have been shared by the esteemed Belgium virologist Dr. Vanden Bossche. He too has considerable credentials that make his views worth consideration. He has PhD degree in Virology from the University of Hohenheim, Germany. He held faculty appointments at universities in Belgium and Germany. He was at the German Center for Infection Research in Cologne as Head of the Vaccine Development Office. He has been in the private sector at several vaccine companies (GSK Biologicals, Novartis Vaccines, Solvay Biologicals) where he worked on vaccine R&D as well as vaccine development. He also worked with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) in Geneva as Senior Ebola Program Manager.
His views have been analyzed in a recent article. He too has loudly called for a halt to mass-vaccination programs. He believes that if the jabs are not halted, they could lead to the evolution of stronger and stronger variants of the virus until a ""supervirus"" takes hold and wipes out huge numbers of people.
This is his bold view:
""Given the huge amount of immune escape that will be provoked by mass vaccination campaigns and flanking containment measures, it is difficult to imagine how human interventions would not cause the COVID-19 pandemic to turn into an incredible disaster for global and individual health.""
Here is an essential element of his thinking. Pretty much everything being done in the pandemic doesn't guarantee elimination of the virus. What is happening is selective viral 'immune escape' where viruses continue to be shed from those who are infected [both vaccinated and nonvaccinated] because neutralizing antibodies fail to prevent replication and elimination of the virus.
The evolutionary selection pressure on the virus through 'immune escape,' creates ever more virulent strains of the virus that have a competitive advantage over other variants and will increasingly have the potential to break through the antibody defenses. Defenses provided by the vaccine induced immune system. This is 'vaccine resistance.' What happens is that vaccine makers keep trying to outsmart variants, but fail. So, they keep pushing boosters and yearly vaccine shots. This is the more is better approach. This is aided by suppression of many negative facts about the vaccines by big media.
A frightening forecast by Bossche is that the worst of the pandemic is still to come. Hard to believe considering all the bad news propaganda about cases, hospitalizations and deaths. But he thinks we are now experiencing the calm before the ultimate storm. Imagine a new wave of infection far worse than anything we've seen so far is how Bossche thinks.
How does this happen? There will be more mutants or variants to which the adaptive immune system from vaccine shots provides little resistance. At the same time there will be decreased innate or natural immune effectiveness. Unless people take a number of steps to boost their natural immunity.
Bossche consistently points to a lack of evidence that the existing global, mass vaccination program that has been mounted while there is still significant infection around, is unprecedented and there is no scientific evidence that this will work. This is why he is largely ignored.
He stresses that historic vaccination programs have always emphasized the importance of vaccinating populations prophylactically in the absence of infection pressure.
He also argues that if different types of vaccine were used that provided sterilizing immunity i.e., that prevented immune escape and killed all viruses in those vaccinated, the situation would be entirely different. Most people do not understand that the current experimental vaccines do not actually kill the virus; and that both the vaccinated and nonvaccinated shed the virus. These vaccines do not stop viral transmission. And all the contagion control measures simply to not work effectively enough to stop wide spread of the virus in its various forms.
Here is his big picture view: ""There is only one single thing at stake right now and that is the survival of our human race, frankly speaking.""
But there are more strong words recently said by Bossche to pay attention to:
""every person out there who is 'partially' or 'fully' vaccinated is a walking disease incubation system that puts everyone else at risk of contracting a deadly, vaccine-caused 'variant' that could kill them. The 'vaccinated' are walking murderers spreading disease to others. Getting injected for the Fauci Flu is not only foolish; it is also a form of murder in that unvaccinated people are now at risk of contracting the deadly diseases being manufactured inside the bodies of the vaccinated. If Trump had never introduced the vaccine in the first place, the pandemic would have long ago fizzled out. Since his vaccines continue to be pushed ... however, the 'Delta' variant is spreading like wildfire, soon to be followed by other 'variants' as we enter the fall season.""
This too is a very strong view. The ""mass vaccination program is...unable to generate herd immunity."" If true, there is little hope of seeing the COVID pandemic ending.
What is the solution? Bossche has identified the needed alternative to the current massive vaccine effort. It is this; ""This first critical step can only be achieved by calling an immediate halt to the mass vaccination program and replacing it by widespread use of antiviral chemoprophylactics while dedicating massive public health resources to scaling early multidrug treatments of Covid-19 disease."" This is referring to the early home/outpatient treatment protocols based on cheap, safe and fully approved generics like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine; these also work as preventatives. Pandemic Blunder provides much data and advice on using this treatment approach. So, both virologists support use of what Fauci has blocked.
These action recommendations were also made by Bossche ""Provide - at no cost - early multidrug treatment to all patients in need. Roll out campaigns to promote healthy diets and lifestyle."" In other words, people need to take actions to boost their natural immunity, this should include vitamins and supplements, including this cocktail: vitamin C, vitamin D, zine and quercetin.
Take a moment to consider that Patrick Wood on the Bannon show on August 21 concluded that all the available data from the US and Europe shows some 100,000 people have died from the COVID experimental vaccines. I agree with that assessment. And by the time you read this FDA may have given full approval to the Pfizer vaccine.
After considering what these two experts have said it is appropriate to criticize what current government officials say, namely blame the unvaccinated for the surges in COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The major alternative to this thinking is that it is the vaccinated people who are creating pandemic problems, including the variants. The strong conclusion is that the current vaccines are ineffective, nonprotective and dangerous.
What is needed is an entirely new approach to COVID vaccines. Perhaps there are companies working on this. This would threaten the trillion-dollar business of the current vaccine makers.
If the people, agencies and institutions with all the power listening to these two very smart people they would devote all their energies to using alternatives to the current vaccines. We have them. Notably, the treatment protocols that so many great doctors have created and used to help their patients.
Many other physicians and medical researchers have called for a halt to the current vaccine bonanza for big drug companies. In the meantime, on a daily basis for all those willing to look at the facts, it is clearer and clearer that the experimental vaccines are not effective. It is insanity to keep doing or expanding what is not working. That is the insane world we are now experiencing even as more and people die from breakthrough infections, blood problems and other bad vaccine health impacts.
Perhaps the ugly truth about the vaccines will be widely revealed only when there are massive, widespread deaths despite all the shots and jabs. That will be too late to change pandemic management from money-driven stupidity to life-saving, medically moral actions.

"The most vaccinated countries have the most cases and deaths per million population and the least vaccinated countries have the fewest cases and deaths per million population.
Devastating Israel figures show 80-90% of cases are vaccinated and an Oxford University study shows the vaccinated could be super spreaders. This was all predicted by leading authorities in the field but on both sides of the Atlantic Government vaccine lies continue.
As Dr Janci Lindsay, MD Toxicology & Molecular Biology, Technology Support Services LLC asserts:
""It is the vaccinated not the unvaccinated spreading the mutant variants"" (thus confirming Nobel Prize Winner Professor Luc Montagnier's theory - RA) This is what has happened with numerous other ""leaky"" (non neutralising) vaccines. The classic example is Marek's Disease in chickens. I warned the CDC (the USA Centre for Disease Control) of this in April this year. Other scientists warned the CDC as well""
I have compiled these tables below which set out the cases per million population and the deaths per million population of, firstly, the most vaccinated countries and secondly the least vaccinated countries. The final column in the first table is the date at which the country started vaccinations and after which the majority of all their cases and deaths occurred. Only in Saudi Arabia did the majority of cases occur before the vaccination start date but the cases did start to rise again after that.
I took the stats on the 12th August 2021. Average cases for the most vaccinated countries stood at 77,491 per million compared to only 19,672 in the least vaccinated. Average deaths in the most vaccinated countries were 1,647 per million compared to only 427 deaths in the least vaccinated.
To those who would counter that ""naturally the worst affected countries would ensure the most vaccinations which is not the same as the vaccinations causing the cases"" I would point to the majority of ALL their cases occurring AFTER they started vaccinating - the start date is in the third column ...
Important and carefully research article by Rodney Atkinson revealing the data.
The causality remains to be fully ascertained. There is another important factor which must be investigated.
Vaccinated persons suffering from injuries will seek medical attention at a health clinic or at the hospital where he/she was vaccinated. These individuals will immediately be subjected to a medical diagnosis as well as to a routine RT-PCR test, which will contribute to pushing up the number of Covid positive cases.
It's statistics 101. It pertains to ""probabilities"". The probability of a vaccinated individual suffering from adverse effects (seeking medical attention) being subject to the PCR-test (in a clinic or a hospital) is much higher than that pertaining to a healthy unvaccinated individual.
Moreover, there is rising trend in vaccine deaths and injuries which the health authorities are anxious to obfuscate.
Ask yourself. What is the cause of this trend among the vaccinated? The SARS-2 Delta Variant or the Killer Vaccine?
The vaccinated person subjected to the flawed RT-PCR test is categorized as ""positive"" or is diagnosed as a ""probable"" Covid-19 positive. And the numbers of covid positive cases assigned to the ""vaccinated"" go fly high.
In turn, in the US, the ""certifiers"" are instructed to indicate Covid-19 as ""the underlying cause of death"" ""more often than not"". And no autopsy is allowed.
The deaths and injuries resulting from the mRNA vaccine are now being assigned to the ""deadly"" SARS-2 Delta Variant.

"Today, the Singapore government has banished hundreds of thousands of citizens from public life for the high crime of making a free choice.
Today, I refuse to participate in this segregated society.
Starting from today, without proof of vaccination, unvaccinated Singaporeans will not be allowed to dine in, or to visit malls and attractions. They can’t even transit through a mall integrated into a train station just to leave the area. Unvaccinated students at tertiary education institutions may not dine in at canteens or restaurants in school premises. Unvaccinated individuals need to show proof of an appointment before being allowed to access medical services inside a mall, while unvaccinated parents must produce a ‘letter of support’ from a childcare agency before they can pick up and drop off their children at childcare centres inside malls. Only unvaccinated people who have previously recovered from Covid-19 are exempt from these rules. Otherwise, unvaccinated people must produce a negative pre-event test result before being allowed entry into a mall for the duration of an activity or service—a test which could cost between $30 to $65 per test (cheaper if bought in bulk), and is good for only 1 day.
I have heard of private companies barring unvaccinated customers from entry even though they are not covered under the new rules. Restaurants that refuse to serve unvaccinated customers with valid PET tests. A bookstore chain that refuses all unvaccinated people from entry. A healthcare group that will not allow unvaccinated patients from booking medical appointments. An enrichment centre that will not accept unvaccinated children. Some car parks even have guards checking visitors for vaccination status.
With most critical services concentrated in malls, including banking, healthcare, childcare and supermarkets, unvaccinated Singaporeans are now treated as second class citizens. The only exemptions are the honorary vaccinated: those with natural immunity, or those with deep pockets and spare time.
The government calls this ‘vaccine differentiated measures’. This is nothing less than vaccine segregation. It divides society between those who made the choice the government wants and those who have not.
The government claims that there is no vaccine mandate and that the choice to vaccinate is voluntary. Yet the increasing restrictions aimed solely at unvaccinated people reveal this claim to be hollow. A choice made under duress is not a choice.
The greatest tragedy is that these measures will not work.
The government claims that vaccine segregation is necessary to prevent infections from overwhelming the medical system. Yet it has consistently ignored data showing the world how to do this.
Early this year, the top five vaccinated countries in the world saw Covid surges: the Seychelles, the UAE, Bahrain, Israel and Chile. The Seychelles and Bahrain, along with highly vaccinated countries like Uruguay and the Maldives, have also recorded some of the highest daily infections worldwide.
This should have been a warning sign. The government failed to heed it. Instead, it consistently pushed for mass vaccinations.
Countries with high vaccination levels are seeing huge numbers of excess deaths and transmissions as well. Scotland’s excess deaths are at the highest since January, even though over 91% of the population over the age of 18 has been vaccinated. 92% of adults in Ireland are vaccinated, and Ireland is also seeing the highest rate of patients hospitalised with Covid since March. The county of Waterford in Ireland is 99.7% vaccinated, and has Ireland’s second highest Covid incidence rate. Vermont is the most vaccinated state in the US, and is also seeing the highest case counts.
Countries that have seen a sharp spike in the demographic of singly-vaccinated persons tend to see a rise in deaths as well. These include Palestine, Israel, Thailand and others. We are possibly seeing this pattern in Singapore, too. Of the 239 Covid deaths in Singapore, 161 occurred in the first three weeks of October, which came after a fresh wave of Covid restrictions and pushes for mass vaccination.
The vaccine will not stop the spread of the virus. It cannot. It does not sterilize, it can only mitigate symptoms and reduce the possibility of death. Vaccinated individuals are just as likely to catch and spread Covid as unvaccinated individuals. In addition, a majority of Covid patients who require oxygen supplementation and ICU care are fully vaccinated. The best case interpretation that the vaccine’s protections do not last, and are now waning. The worst case is that the vaccinated are superspreaders.
Unvaccinated persons are more likely to develop symptoms than the vaccinated. When an unvaccinated person is infected, he is likelier to develop symptoms, and is then likely to seek medical treatment and be isolated from others. When a vaccinated person is infected, he is less likely to develop symptoms. Without symptoms, without routine testing, he won’t know that he is infected, and will continue to spread the virus to those around him.
It is also possible that mass vaccination drives the evolution of the virus, selecting for more dangerous strains in the future. This was seen in Marek’s disease in chickens. The vaccine against Marek’s disease does not prevent infection, only prevent symptoms. This allowed increasingly virulent strains of the disease to survive in vaccinated chickens and spread to other chickens, instead of killing the host before it could spread. As a result, Marek’s disease now kills 100% of all unvaccinated chickens.
The Covid vaccines are also the most dangerous ever developed in recent memory. Reported adverse events and deaths from the Covid vaccine in one year is an order of magnitude higher than all vaccines combined in the past 10 years.
The data is clear. The vaccines are potentially dangerous, they cannot stop the spread of disease, and therefore they cannot prevent the hospital system from being overwhelmed. The government has refused to grapple with this data, or even acknowledge it.
Singapore will reap the bitter harvest. Singapore continues to reap this harvest.
Compliance does not work.
Compliance merely signals that the people will continue to go along with the government. The government has no reason not to continue to scapegoat the unvaccinated, or to impose harsher measures. The government claims that the current ‘Stabilisation Phase’ will be extended to 21 November, but there is nothing stopping them from further extending them. There is no media or opposition party that will keep the government in check.
Compliance merely leads to more of the same. More restrictions, more discrimination, more misery. The way out of this crisis is to signal clearly that enough is enough.
This is the time for non-compliance.
This is the time to step away from a segregated society.
Through this new round of ‘vaccine differentiated measures’, the government has sent a powerful signal to the unvaccinated: you are not welcome in society.
To this I say: So be it.
Let us all walk away from a society that discriminates against those whose only sin was to make a choice the government said was voluntary.
What does this mean?
Do not visit any malls, restaurants, attractions, hawker centres, anywhere that demands proof of vaccination before you can enter. If you are dependent on essential services inside a mall, switch to another provider as soon as possible. Do not go to any standalone shop or service provider that requires proof of vaccination to enter even where it is not required. Do not work for anyone who demands that you get vaccinated, or demands you to enforce vaccine discrimination. Do not take any PET tests and do not attend any events or go anywhere that requires a PET test. Do not go where you are not welcome, do not give time or money to those who do not want to do business with you, do not participate in a society that rejects you, do not collaborate with those who discriminate against others.
Do not make outrageous statements or do anything stupid. The government and the media are employing Saul Alinsky’s Rule 12 for Radicals. They identify someone who can be ridiculed in public, frame him as the representative of the ‘anti-vaxxer movement’, and cut off everyone who walks away from outside support networks. This is how they have demonised people who criticise Covid vaccines and propose alternative treatments. Do not allow them to turn you into a weapon against your friends and family. Show people you are exactly who you say you are: a sane, ordinary person.
Do not break the law. To enforce vaccine discrimination, the government will employ scores of police officers, safety distancing ambassadors and other such personnel. They already have a hard job, and they are more likely than you to come into contact the virus. Do not make their lives harder than it is, and they will return the favour. Do not do anything that will give the Establishment a reason to paint you as an enemy of the people more than they already are.
Do develop a side income. With increasing pressure to vaccinate, you must expect an employer vaccination mandate to come down the line. You must get ahead of this by creating a side income that is not dependent on vaccination, or even in-person work. This includes remote work, Internet freelancing, creating video courses and information products, and so on. Be prepared to turn the side income into a full-time income in the worst case scenario.
Do support each other. With so many essential services concentrated in malls, people are now rushing to identify shops, clinics, supermarkets and childcare facilities that are not included in this round of measures. SG Connect Concerned Parents on Telegram is compiling a list of such businesses. I have seen vaccinated people volunteering to run errands on behalf of those who can’t. Support small local businesses who are not covered under the vaccine discrimination rules, and are willing to do business with you. Similarly, identify shops that will not do business with the unvaccinated even if they are not covered under the new Covid regulations, and boycott them. To get through this period, we must all help each other out.
Do understand your rights. I have seen job advertisements for vaccinated people only. I have heard of a doctor who refused to treat an unvaccinated patient. I have seen reports that government agencies are dividing visitors by vaccination status, and are forcing unvaccinated visitors to wait in longer queues. Expect employers and stores to pressure you to get vaccinated. You must be aware of your rights. Recognize that it is presently illegal for employers to fire someone for not being vaccinated, and that a refusal to treat an unvaccinated patient is a violation of medical ethics. Going beyond that, you must be prepared to stand up for your rights, and push back against those who would take it from you.
Do take care of your health. Less than 1% of Covid transmissions take place outdoors. A leading driver of Covid deaths is obesity and vitamin deficiencies. Spend more time exercising in the sun, eat healthy, and look after your health. This is far cheaper and way more convenient than dealing with a disease down the line, Covid or otherwise.
Do not cling to the hope that things will get better. It may happen, once the virus naturally burns itself out, but be prepared for this period to last a long time.
Do prepare yourself for things to get worse. Be prepared for the government to further increase restrictions, for the media to paint you as an enemy of the people, for your friends and family to turn against you, for you to lose everything. As far as possible, pre-empt all this from happening by decoupling yourself from a society that does not want you. Do this now, while you still can.
Do not go out of your way to make enemies. Do not disrespect, degrade, mock, curse or otherwise discriminate against those who have made different choices from you. They have made their choices; let them live by them. Always remember that the Establishment is always looking for an excuse to cast you as deranged lunatic who wants to place everyone at risk.
Do be the best person you can be. Now, more than ever, is the time to practice the great virtues. Patience, equanimity, charity, goodwill, compassion, kindness, forgiveness, courage. Be a light unto the world and set an example for everyone—your friends, family, even complete strangers.
Do not despair.
Do live in faith.
All this demands much of you. Discipline, fortitude, good cheer, resilience, planning, endurance. Remember that the ‘minority’ the Establishment wants to segregate represents hundreds of thousands of people like you. With 85% of the population vaccinated, that leaves over 818,000 people affected by vaccine discrimination. You are not alone in this.
The government is trialing Covid vaccine boosters. Should they be approved for the general populace, the next step is to follow in the footsteps of Israel: only those who have taken the booster shot will be considered fully vaccinated. After all, the numbers in Singapore are showing that vaccine protections are fading, and the vaccine is supposed to be for your protection.
Proof of vaccination has now become a de facto Covid pass. It becomes easy to mimic Lithuania: everyone without proof of vaccination will be banned from stores, restaurants, supermarkets, banks, anywhere indoors. What is happening in Singapore now is only a few steps removed from Lithuania, so there is still room for medical tyranny to expand.
There may come a day that the only way to participate in public life is to take the vaccine every few months. A still-experimental vaccine whose long-term safety data is unknown, which is already showing signs of high risk. Any government with the power to make you take the vaccine has the power to make you comply with the government in all things in the name of public health and safety. Taking the vaccine will no longer be for your protection, but to prove your obedience. Refusal to take the vaccine will mark you as an enemy of the state.
To prevent that day from coming, we must walk away now, and show that this is the one line that the people will not cross, that the establishment can only go so far and not one step beyond.
The great dream of Singapore is that people from different backgrounds can come together to create a peaceful and prosperous society. The role of the government is to realize this dream and to preserve it for future generations. The imposition of medical segregation has shattered this dream.
Beyond walking away from a society that rejects you, it is time to demand for accountability.
I do not expect the government to change course anytime soon. I do expect it to grow desperate, to impose even tighter restrictions, and to fudge the numbers further. Already Singapore lumps together unvaccinated and partially vaccinated people together. It leaves one wondering what other data it is hiding. Having imposed vaccine discrimination on Singapore, and having created the current situation we are in, the government must take responsibility.
The government must lift all restrictions. Until then, the Republic of Singapore will remain a divided nation, with a country of the vaccinated and a country of those who walk away. The government must respect what was supposed to be a free and personal choice. If someone chooses to accept the elevated risk of severe illness and death, the government should respect that.
The government must be totally transparent with Covid data. No more obfuscations. No more lumping together unvaccinated and partially vaccinated. No more hiding embarrassing numbers. Present all the data.
The government must allow people to freely choose alternative medical treatments. People will take drugs like Ivermectin regardless of legality. And for good reason. Ivermectin has recorded 3680 adverse events in America from 1996 to October 2021. This is two orders of magnitude lower in 35 years than the Covid vaccines in 1 year. If people wish to use a medicine that is extremely well-tolerated and much safer than the Covid vaccines, it is better to have them take human-dose drugs under the guidance of a medical professional. The risk of adverse reactions is much lower the vaccine, and the payoff of prevention and rapid treatment of Covid is much higher than the payoff of a leaky vaccine that cannot stop transmissions.
The government must immediately stop mass vaccination campaigns against Covid. With so much data on adverse reactions and unknown long-term risks, any responsible government must err on the side of caution. People should still be allowed to take the vaccine if they feel the risk of infection outweighs the potential harm from the vaccine, but there should be no further pressure or encouragement to take the vaccine. The government must review and make public safety data concerning the vaccine.
The government must ensure all persons who choose to take the vaccine are informed of the risks. This includes but is not limited risks of death and disease from Covid versus risk of adverse reactions, the possibility of antibody dependent enhancement, and the risk of long-term unknown health effects.
Singapore’s nation-building media is not known for investigative journalism, or indeed asking hard questions. With the future of Singapore on the line, it is high time to start asking the hard questions.
What criteria and what data is the government using to decide policies?
Why did governments and the media the world over call Ivermectin ‘horse dewormer’ when Ivermectin has successfully treated millions of people over 40 years with minimal side effects, and shows promise as a Covid treatment?
Why did Singapore support BioNTech’s move to open a new regional headquarters in Singapore and produce mRNA vaccines?
How many people have died after taking the vaccine, and how many have suffered adverse reactions? Why does the government insist that the vaccine has not caused any deaths, while other governments such as Taiwan have attributed high numbers of deaths to the vaccine?
Why is the government fudging the Covid patient numbers? What is the full breakdown of cases by vaccination status?
What qualifies as a vaccine adverse reaction? Why do some doctors believe that some illnesses that occurred after being vaccinated do not qualify as an adverse reaction? What criteria do the authorities use to judge whether a death was indeed caused by the vaccine?
Do hospitals require patients to sign a form declaring that an illness is not a vaccine injury?
Which companies are deliberately discriminating against the unvaccinated, even if the regulations do not require them to do it?
I must confess, I reserve the greatest ire for the opposition.
They have one job: to keep the government in check. To represent the interests of the people. To ensure the government does its job well.
Covid-19 represents the most pressing crisis of our generation. Not since separation from Malaysia has Singapore faced an emergency of this magnitude. In this most critical of hours, most of the opposition has remained silent.
Who raised concerns about vaccine safety? Who discussed mask mandates and lockdowns? Who spoke against medical tyranny? Who asked the hard questions?
Brad Bowyer did. For this, he was brigaded by government and vaccine supporters, suspended from Facebook, and eventually resigned from the Progress Singapore Party.
Leong Mun Wai, Professor Paul Tambyah and Goh Meng Seng also spoken out against various aspects of vaccine discrimination and public policy.
Who else?
I have received private messages about certain opposition members who oppose vaccine discrimination as well. Nonetheless, they have not spoken publicly, either as a party member or as an individual. If they will not speak up now, when the government has divided one united Singapore into two countries, when will they ever speak? How can they claim to represent Singaporeans when they will not speak up for the most oppressed minority?
As the Establishment clamors for more vaccines, more discrimination, more and more and more measures, the silence of the opposition rings the loudest.
There could be three reasons for this:
1. The party lacks the data to make a coherent party-wide policy position. In this case, by continuing to share information on vaccines and related matters, we can yet reach out to them.
2. The party believes it lacks the political capital to make a stand. It is afraid if it contradicts the narrative, it will be attacked by the Establishment and by its supporters. We must thus demonstrate there is a groundswell of sentiment against medical tyranny of all forms, and encourage them to act.
3. The party supports the government’s policies. In which case, we must treat it no differently from the government.
Regardless of the reasons, I will remember the silence.
We who walk away will remember.
We cannot count on the opposition to save us. We cannot rely on the media to speak for us.
We cannot pray that the government will take mercy on us.
We must take our lives into our own hands, and live by the choices we make.
Do not go where you, your friends and family are not wanted.
Do not give money to those who do not want you there.
Do not collaborate with those who oppress you.
Do not comply with coercion.
Do not break the law.
Do look after each other.
Do become a light for others.
Do continue to speak up against segregation.
Do stand your ground even if the world is against you.
Do live in faith, stay the course, and perservere until the end.
There will come a day when this medical tyranny will end. There will come a day when the truth will be finally revealed to the world. There will come a day when we can once again call ourselves one united people, where people will no longer be discriminated against for making a free choice.
With every person who walks away, that day draws nearer.
