Boon Lay slashing: Two men charged with causing hurt with a dangerous weapon,"SINGAPORE: Two men were charged on Saturday (Apr 9) with using bread knives to attack two victims at Boon Lay Drive. Muhammad Sajid Saleem, 20, and Niswan Thiruchelvam, 19, each face one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon. They appeared in the State Courts via video-link from remand dressed in white shirts, and did not show any expression as they listened to the charges.  The judge ordered them to be remanded in prison for a week, with permission to be taken out for investigations and recovery of exhibits. They will return to court on Apr 14. The alleged attack on Wednesday was captured on videos and photos that were widely circulated on social media. Police said that they responded to multiple calls for assistance at Block 175, Boon Lay Drive at about 5pm on Wednesday. Two male victims aged 22 and 23 were taken to the hospital with multiple lacerations to their heads and limbs. The suspects were arrested in Woodlands on Thursday, after an islandwide manhunt. Preliminary investigations revealed that they were known to the victims. On Friday, the two suspects were escorted back to the car park where the attack allegedly took place to aid in investigations. They were flanked by plain clothes police officers, who asked them questions and also led them to a hair salon and two parks nearby. Videos of the aftermath of the attack seen by CNA showed the two men wielding their weapons in what appeared to be a car park. The men paced back and forth and were later seen running away, still holding the weapons. One of the victims appeared to have blood running down his face as he was attended to by another person. Those who voluntarily cause grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon can be jailed for life, or jailed for up to 15 years with a fine and caning.",0
Engineer dies after falling 30m at CapitaSpring building,"SINGAPORE: A 48-year-old engineer died on Friday morning (Apr 8) after falling seven storeys at the CapitaSpring building in the central business district. ""A 48-year-old local engineer was working on the maintenance level above the 16th floor of the building when she stepped on a false ceiling panel,"" a Ministry of Manpower (MOM) spokesperson said on Saturday. ""The panel gave way under her weight, causing her to fall about 30m. She landed on the ninth floor and was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. ""As a general safety measure, fragile surfaces should be marked clearly and conspicuously to warn of the risk of falling from height."" The Singapore Civil Defence Force said it received a call for assistance at about 11am on Friday, and the person was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic. The woman was an employee of Dragages Singapore, a contractor of CapitaSpring, said a spokesperson for the office building's management. ""We are saddened by the passing of an employee of our contractor Dragages Singapore due to an incident involving a fall from height in the building on Friday. Our thoughts are with the loved ones of our contractor's late employee and we are extending our assistance to the family,"" said CapitaSpring. “Workplace safety is of utmost importance to us and we require all contractors and vendors to use appropriate equipment and follow safety procedures. We are giving our full cooperation to the authorities in their investigations of the incident.""MOM said it is investigating the accident and has instructed the occupier of CapitaSpring, Ascott International Management, to stop all access to the maintenance level. This is the 11th workplace fatality this year and it follows several incidents last year involving falls from height, said the National Trades Union Congress' (NTUC) assistant secretary-general Melvin Yong. ""I’m deeply saddened to learn that another worker’s life was lost due to a fall from height,"" he said in a Facebook post on Saturday. ""We need to put in place specific measures quickly to prevent similar accidents from happening."" Mr Yong added that it is important for the building's design team to consciously assess the need for facilities maintenance activities in the void areas above any false ceiling panels.""Such panels are not typically load-bearing and there has to be specific ways designed to facilitate work required on top of these panels,"" he wrote. ""If any activities are required, then the design has to incorporate safe catwalks - ideally with reflective low light emitting tapes - and work platforms, to ensure such activities can be carried out safely and also to deter anyone from stepping on false ceiling panels. Proper risk assessment also has to be done prior to start of work.  ""This process is a shared responsibility for all stakeholders - developers, contractors or designers. I call on everyone to do our part, and learn from past accidents so that we prevent future ones from occurring."" CapitaSpring, located at 88 Market Street, is a new 51-storey integrated development that was completed in 2021. ",0
Singapore recalls three more Kinder chocolate products due to possible presence of salmonella,"SINGAPORE: A recall of Kinder chocolate has been extended to three additional products due to the possible presence of salmonella, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said on Friday (Apr 8). They are Kinder Mini Eggs, Kinder Egg Hunt Kit and Kinder Surprise Maxi from Belgium, SFA said. The affected products have a best before date between Apr 20 and Aug 21, 2022, the agency added. SFA said the latest recall follows a recall alert issued by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland for the products due to possible presence of salmonella - a pathogenic bacterium that can cause foodborne illnesses such as fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea. SFA has directed importers Redmart and Le Petit Depot to recall the products and the recall is ongoing. ""Consumers who have consumed the implicated products and have concerns about their health should seek medical advice. Consumers may contact the importers for enquiries,"" it said. SFA had earlier announced a recall of Kinder Surprise chocolate on Wednesday. On Friday, Belgian health authorities ordered Italian confectionery group Ferrero - which produces Kinder chocolates - to suspend production at its plant in Arlon, Belgium, after Europe’s health agency launched an investigation into dozens of cases of salmonella potentially linked to the chocolates.",0
"Singaporean Ix Shen returns to Ukraine, joins volunteer group to provide humanitarian aid","SINGAPORE: Singaporean Ix Shen is back in Ukraine to help in humanitarian efforts after he and his Ukrainian wife left the war-torn country for Poland last month. 
In an Instagram video posted on Friday (Apr 8), the former actor said he is in a ""safe place"" and will not be revealing his exact location in Ukraine for ""security reasons"". Mr Shen, who has been providing regular updates to CNA as the situation unfolds in Ukraine, said has joined a group of volunteers who provide humanitarian aid from Poland.
""So we stocked up the supplies in the vehicles, we drive across the border and redistribute them in different centres,"" said Mr Shen, adding that one of these centres is in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.
The town was occupied by Russian forces in the early days of the invasion, AFP reported. There have been allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes by executing civilians in Bucha, with Ukraine accusing Russia of carrying out a ""massacre"". The Kremlin has denied the allegations. ""I believe by now you should have heard of this place,"" said Mr Shen, referring to Bucha. ""This issue right now is being contested by different parties. Since I'm not an expert in putrefaction, I'm not qualified to comment."" Mr Shen added that ""truth always prevails because the same thing happened to us before"", pointing to the Sook Ching massacre, a Japanese military operation during the occupation that was aimed at purging anti-Japanese elements from the Chinese community in Singapore. ""Eighty years ago, also in the month of March, we had innocent civilians being slaughtered, and back then we didn't have forensic science,"" he said. ""Our forefathers paid such (a) heavy price and gave us such precious lessons. How can we not unturn our backs towards injustice?"" Ukrainian investigators on Friday began to exhume a mass grave in Bucha, opening the early stages of what police said will be a war crimes case targeting Russian troops who occupied the town.  The grave - a long deep trench in the mud behind a gold-domed church - was used by Ukrainians to bury neighbours they claim were killed at the hands of Russian armed forces that arrived on Feb 26.",0
Tanglin Halt Food Centre attack: 69-year-old man charged with using wooden stick with nail to hit victim,"SINGAPORE: A 69-year-old man was charged on Saturday (Apr 9) with voluntarily causing hurt after an incident at Tanglin Halt Food Centre that left a hawker injured. 
Peck Chuan Ann is accused of attacking Punnataro Wee Kai Xin with a 71cm-long wooden stick that had a nail protruding from it, according to the charge sheet. The investigation officer said in the charge sheet that the wooden stick with a nail was “used as a weapon of offence” and was “likely to cause death”. The victim was hit on the head and suffered a cut.
If convicted, Peck faces a jail term of up to seven years, a fine, or any combination of such punishments.
Peck, who has been remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation, cannot be caned as he is over 50 years old.
He is set to return to court on Apr 22. On Friday, police said preliminary investigations revealed that Peck was known to Mr Wee, 51, and his girlfriend Ms Wang Wei, 54. They run a fish soup stall at Tanglin Halt Food Centre along Commonwealth Drive. The pair told CNA that they had just reopened the stall on Monday after taking a few months off since Ms Wang had been in hospital.
At about 7am, Mr Wee was seated outside the stall as he was cleaning and chopping vegetables while Ms Wang was inside the stall preparing fish. 
Ms Wang recounted that she heard a commotion, and turned around to see the perpetrator allegedly hitting Mr Wee with a wooden stick. 
She quickly rushed out of the stall and tried to grab the stick, with the man also allegedly hitting her several times on the head and arm.
A photograph of Mr Wee's injuries showed him bleeding profusely. When CNA visited Tanglin Halt Food Centre at about 4pm, bloodstains could be seen on the floor near Ms Wang and Mr Wee’s stall. ",0
"Driver and 2 passengers charged after trying to evade Tuas Checkpoint clearance, injuring ICA officer","SINGAPORE: A driver and two passengers were charged in the State Courts on Saturday (Apr 9) after crashing into the counters at Tuas Checkpoint while trying to evade departure clearance.
Singaporean Teo Thiam Leng, 46, the driver of the Malaysia-registered car, was charged with dangerous driving in the incident that took place early on Friday morning. He is accused of reversing his vehicle at the motorcycle arrival zone of Tuas Checkpoint and hitting an Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer, causing hurt.
He was also given a charge of abetting the importation of 33g of methamphetamine into Singapore in 2016.
The court heard that Teo has a previous conviction for drug-related offences. In 2007, he was sentenced to five years' jail and five strokes of the cane for trafficking ketamine.
The ICA said on Friday that Teo was wanted by the police and Central Narcotics Bureau.
The two passengers, 35-year-old Chinese national Chen Songqing and 31-year-old Vietnamese national Ho Thi My Nhung, were each given one charge of criminal trespass. Teo and Ho have been remanded for investigations. Chen, who is in hospital, will also be remanded after his discharge. All three are set to return to court next week.
THE INCIDENT
The trio were arrested after trying to enter Singapore in the early hours of Friday morning.
According to the ICA, they evaded departure clearance at Malaysia's Komplex Sultan Abu Bakar at about 2.15am.

The car then sped towards Tuas Checkpoint while being pursued by Malaysia's Traffic Police. 
An auxiliary police officer deployed at the entrance of Tuas Checkpoint towards Malaysia spotted the speeding vehicle and activated the alarm, locking down the checkpoint. To ""circumvent"" the lockdown, ICA said the driver attempted to ""force his way into Singapore"" through the automated motorcycle clearance lanes.
""However, the lanes were too narrow and the vehicle was incapacitated after crashing into the counters,"" said the authority, adding that an ICA officer suffered an abrasion on his right ankle in the process.
Chen and Ho then tried to flee the scene on foot but were intercepted. Both were allegedly not in possession of valid travel documents.

Teo was also detained. He was allegedly in possession of a tampered Singapore passport, and tested positive for drug consumption in a preliminary urine test.
For dangerous driving causing hurt to another person, Teo could be jailed up to two years, fined up to S$10,000 or both. The penalties are increased if he is a repeat offender.  He also faces 10 to 30 years' jail and 10 to 15 strokes of the cane if convicted of abetting the importation of drugs. He is liable for enhanced punishment given his previous conviction.
The punishment for criminal trespass is jail for up to three months, a fine of up to S$1,500 or both.",0
Probation report called for man who molested 9-year-old niece while she feigned sleep,"SINGAPORE: A 22-year-old man admitted on Friday (Apr 8) to molesting his underaged niece about 10 times a year while she pretended to be asleep.
The offences happened from 2014 to 2017, when the victim was aged nine to 12 and the offender was about 15 to 18 years old. Their identities are protected by gag order. The judge ordered a probation suitability report after the man pleaded guilty to three counts of outraging the modesty of a minor.
Three more charges will be taken into consideration when he returns to court for sentencing next month.
The court heard that the victim and offender lived together with other family members from 2005 to 2020.
In 2014, the offender, the victim and the victim's brother were sleeping in the same room at home. The offender slept on the lower deck of a bunk bed, and the victim on a pull-out bed next to him.
One night, the victim woke up when she felt her uncle carrying her. He placed her face-down on his bed. He then removed her clothes and molested her.
After he was done, he cleaned the victim's body with a towel, put her clothes back on and placed her back on her bed.
The victim did not consent to the acts, said the prosecution. She pretended to be asleep the whole time as she was afraid of her uncle.
He continued to outrage her modesty in a similar manner over the years, carrying her to his bed while she feigned sleep as she was afraid.
On one occasion in 2017, he carried the victim to his room from the bed she was sharing with her grandmother. The victim woke up when he entered the room, but her grandmother was asleep and unaware. These acts only came to light in 2020, when the victim's stepfather confronted her about some messages she had sent to her ex-boyfriend.
The victim then tearfully revealed what her uncle had done to her, and was brought to make a police report.
The offender stopped the acts in 2017, when the victim started menstruating. The prosecution said the victim's relationship with her uncle improved in 2019, and she ""stopped resenting him as much"".
The defence urged the court to call for a probation suitability report, arguing that the offender was very young when the offences started and ignorant of the law then.
The defence also highlighted that the offender stopped the acts of his own accord, and not because he had been caught.
He cooperated fully with investigations and volunteered details that were not part of the allegations initially made against him, added the lawyer.
The prosecution did not object to the calling of a probation suitability report.
For each count of outraging the modesty of a minor, the man could be jailed up to five years, fined, caned or sentenced to any combination of these punishments.",0
"Fire breaks out at Beo Crescent flat, blaze linked to electric bicycle battery: SCDF","SINGAPORE: Firefighters from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) extinguished a fire at Block 38 Beo Crescent on Friday (Apr 8). The fire, which involved the contents of a living room in a unit on the 10th floor, had originated from the battery pack of a power-assisted bicycle (PAB) which was charging in the living room at the time, according to preliminary investigations. The SCDF responded to the fire at about 8.15am on Friday. When officers arrived at the scene, the fire was raging, with thick black smoke coming from the unit. Firefighters donning breathing apparatus sets then extinguished the fire with a water jet. About 30 people from neighbouring units had self-evacuated prior to SCDF’s arrival. There were no reported injuries.  As a result of the fire, the entire unit and a section of the corridor were affected by heat and smoke damage, said SCDF. The Jalan Besar Town Council said in a Facebook post on Friday that several units were also affected, with the fire damaging the corridor and several power supply cables. ""Jalan Besar Town Council’s quick response team was activated and was on site to check on the affected residents,"" it said.
""We are also working closely with the relevant agencies such as Housing & Development Board (HDB) and Residents' Committee (RC) to assist those affected.""
SCDF reminded owners of personal mobility devices and power-assisted bicycles to not charge batteries for an extended period of time or overnight. They should also refrain from buying or using non-original batteries. ",0
Longer processing time of about 7 weeks for vehicle entry permit applications: LTA,"SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Friday (Apr 8) warned of longer processing times for vehicle entry permit (VEP) applications amid an influx of submissions following the reopening of land borders with Malaysia last week.
The authority said it has received about 76,000 VEP applications as of Thursday – more than six times the weekly average before the land borders were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the safety of all road users in Singapore, LTA added that it performs “thorough checks” of supporting documents submitted for VEP applications and renewals, including checking for valid vehicle insurance.
“Based on current volume, the processing time is about seven weeks. Applicants are notified of the processing time at the point of application,” it said.
In addition to planning ahead, LTA also “strongly encouraged” leisure travellers to defer their plans to allow those with essential travel needs, such as for employment or to reunite with their families, to make their trips. Applications must be done online via the VEP Digital Services on LTA's OneMotoring website as submissions will no longer be accepted at Singapore’s land checkpoints to facilitate traffic flow.
Applicants must provide clear copies of their identity card or passport, immigration pass card, vehicle registration certificate, vehicle certificate of insurance and vehicle road tax disc. Drivers of foreign-registered vehicles must have LTA’s VEP approval email and Autopass card before they travel.
Those without Autopass cards must collect their Autopass cards at LTA’s Johor Bahru Service Centre located at 34 Jalan Tun Abdul Razak Susur 1 before entering Singapore.",0
"Coach services between Singapore and KL, Genting now available after full border reopening","SINGAPORE: Following the full reopening of land borders earlier this month, travel agencies in Singapore have resumed coach services to destinations in Malaysia such as Kuala Lumpur and Genting. 
KKKL Travel & Tours said on its Facebook page on Wednesday (Apr 6) it was resuming direct trips between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, as well as between Singapore and Melaka. Trips to destinations such as Genting Highlands, Tioman and Port Dickson are also in the works, it added. 
Checks on the KKKL website show one-way trips from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur are priced at between S$19 and S$36, while a journey to Malacca costs between S$23 and S$29. 
WTS Travel said on its Facebook page last Friday that it was resuming its coach services to Resorts World Genting. 
Priced from S$85 per ticket, the service is available from nine locations across Singapore, including Ang Mo Kio, Jurong East and Yishun. 
Starmart Express, another agency, listed 15 trips heading from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on Saturday, priced at S$30 each. On Apr 1, Malaysia and Singapore fully reopened their land border - closed for two years due to the coronavirus pandemic - allowing fully vaccinated travellers to move via land between the two countries without quarantine or COVID-19 tests.
The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority reported that more than 33,700 travellers cleared the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints on the first day of the border reopening. 
In addition, travel companies saw bookings for flights out of Singapore double last month after the country announced that it would reopen its borders to all fully vaccinated travellers. ",0
Craft beer made from NEWater to go on public sale for the first time,"SINGAPORE: At first sip, the drink tastes exactly like what it appears to be - a nice, light craft beer. 
Smooth, not overly sweet and with a tinge of bitterness. But the fruity, foamy drink is not your average tipple. It comprises 95 per cent NEWater, Singapore’s high-grade reclaimed water.
Named NEWBrew, it will go on public sale for the first time, from Apr 12 to end-July, said National Water Agency PUB and local craft brewery Brewerkz in a news release on Friday (Apr 8).
The beer can be purchased at NTUC FairPrice and Cold Storage outlets, as well as online platforms and Brewerkz’s restaurant and e-store. Available in packs of three, it will be priced at $4.50 per can.
Each of the three cans has a different design, featuring vibrant artwork of the Marina Barrage, MacRitchie Reservoir and Singapore River - three “iconic local water landmarks” that contribute to Singapore’s water sustainability efforts.
NEWBrew will also be served at Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) 2022 later this month. This is the second time that the craft beer will be served at the event, where it made its debut in 2018. This 2022 version will be a “tropical blonde ale”, with a “smooth, toasted honey-like aftertaste”, said PUB and Brewerkz.
Its ingredients include premium German barley malts, aromatic citra and calypso hops as well as kveik, a strain of farmhouse yeast from Norway. 
“NEWBrew is possibly Singapore’s greenest beer and the perfect accompaniment to this year’s SIWW, with its key themes of climate resilience, resource circularity and water sustainability,” said SIWW managing director Ryan Yuen.
“We are delighted to partner Brewerkz to bring NEWBrew back again, as it is also part of PUB’s efforts to educate Singaporeans on the importance of water recycling and reuse as a strategy to achieve water sustainability. It also reinforces the message that NEWater is perfectly wholesome and safe for drinking, and can be used to make a great tasting beer.”
Brewerkz CEO and owner Tan Wee Han said that there was “strong interest” from the public when the first edition of NEWBrew was launched in 2018, and “demand” for the beer to return.
Said Mr Tan: “We are delighted to unveil this year’s NEWBrew just as we are emerging from the pandemic. NEWBrew is a showcase of the high quality of NEWater and is proof that sustainability can be delicious.”",0
"Singapore abstains from vote to suspend Russia from UN human rights body, urges support for inquiry on violations in Ukraine","SINGAPORE: Singapore has called for all parties to cooperate with an independent commission of inquiry on alleged human rights violations in Ukraine, adding that is important for the commission to be given full and unhindered access to do its work.

This came after it abstained from a vote to suspend Russia from the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council on Thursday (Apr 7). In response to media queries on Friday evening, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said: “Singapore abstained from the vote as we await the findings of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry investigating alleged violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Ukraine."" 

The Commission was mandated by Human Rights Council Resolution 49/1 on the “Situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression”, which was adopted on Mar 4 this year. MFA reiterated that Singapore was a co-sponsor of this resolution. 

“We strongly condemn any violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and there must be accountability. We hence urge all parties to cooperate with the Commission, and allow it full and unhindered access so that it can gather evidence and conduct its work,” said MFA. 

“Our abstention on this particular resolution is consistent with our longstanding and steadfast support for the rules-based multilateral system and the due application of its mechanisms.”

The UN General Assembly had suspended Russia from the Human Rights Council over reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" in Ukraine, prompting Moscow to announce it was quitting the body. The United States-led push garnered 93 votes in favour, while 24 countries voted no and 58 countries abstained, including Singapore. A two-thirds majority of voting members in the 193-member General Assembly in New York - abstentions do not count - was needed to suspend Russia from the 47-member Geneva-based Human Rights Council.

Taking the floor to explain Singapore’s abstention, Ms Tang Jo-Phie, the country’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, said on Thursday that Singapore condemns Russia's invasion of Ukraine and continuing attacks on Ukrainian cities, civilians, and civilian infrastructure in the strongest possible terms.

“We reiterate our full support for the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” she stated. She added that Singapore’s position on this has been clear and consistent from the beginning of the conflict.
This is why it had ""co-sponsored and voted in support of UN General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1 on the Aggression against Ukraine, and Resolution ES-11/2 on the Humanitarian Consequences of the Aggression against Ukraine"", she said.

Singapore also co-sponsored the Human Rights Council Resolution 49/1 on the Situation of Human Rights in Ukraine Stemming from the Russian Aggression, she added.

In her speech, Ms Tang also said: “Singapore is gravely concerned and distressed by the latest reports and images from Bucha and other Ukrainian towns of high civilian casualties and destruction of civilian infrastructure.”

“We strongly condemn any violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. In this regard, we urge the full and urgent implementation of ES-11/1, ES-11/2, and HRC Resolution 49/1.”

She said that Singapore notes the establishment of an independent International Commission of Inquiry to investigate all alleged violations of human rights in Ukraine, adding that the country awaits the completion of the commission’s work and its findings. “There must be accountability for any gross and systematic human rights violations that have taken place in the conflict in Ukraine,” she said.

“We urge all parties to cooperate with the commission’s work and allow full and unhindered access for the commission to gather evidence and conduct its work.”

She added: “We must spare no effort to protect the civilian population in Ukraine, and to ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all those in need.”

“We continue to call on the Russian Federation to cease its offensive military operations immediately, to remain engaged in meaningful negotiations with Ukraine, and to work towards a peaceful settlement in accordance with the UN Charter and international law.” Singapore has announced financial measures targeted at designated Russian banks, entities and activities in Russia, as well as fundraising activities benefiting the Russian government.

Wrapping up his visit to the US last week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Singapore took a strong stand against Russia’s invasion because it has chosen to uphold a key principle that corresponds to its long-term national interest – that is, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries.

“We have chosen principles and we uphold principles which correspond to our long-term national interests, and we uphold them consistently,” said Mr Lee.
Other countries that abstained included India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Cambodia. Russia, China and Vietnam were among those that voted against.
In explaining why it had abstained from the vote, the Malaysian delegation to the UN said: “A critical decision such as the suspension of a member of the Human Rights Council must not be made in haste and should not prejudge the outcome of such investigations.”
""A decision on such an important matter must be accorded the same equal treatment and due processes as in the past in the full spirit and letter of resolution 60/251 (on the establishment of the Human Rights Council).""",0
"Author of Nikkei Asia article about KTV COVID-19 cluster fined for having obscene videos, photos","SINGAPORE: A man was fined S$42,000 on Friday (Apr 8) for possessing more than 4,200 obscene videos and photos.

Wong Ming Jun, also known as Andy Wong, 28, had pleaded guilty to three charges of possessing obscene materials, with another eight similar charges considered for sentencing. Wong was the author of an opinion piece in Nikkei Asia that criticised the Government's handling of KTV lounges amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The piece was published in July last year, at the height of the infections linked to KTV lounges around the country. It drew a point-by-point rebuttal from the Ministry of Home Affairs, which called it ""full of inaccuracies"".

Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam questioned Wong's motive at the time, saying: ""We are left to wonder if the criminal investigation against him was the reason for his diatribe based on falsehoods; and the extent to which he was doing a political hack job.""

The offences dealt with on Friday were related to Wong's membership in a Telegram chat group which he joined in November 2018.

The chat group was linked to local forum Sammy Boy Forum, where users discuss pornography and other matters of a sexual nature, said the prosecution. Police were alerted to the chat group on Oct 24, 2019, when a woman informed them that members shared lewd and indecent photos of girls in it and that it had more than 24,000 members.

Wong was arrested in his home on Nov 6, 2019, and his laptop and mobile phone were seized.

Police found more than 4,200 obscene videos and photos spread across these devices and thumb drives.

Among them were about 2,200 obscene videos in Wong's mobile phone, which he had downloaded from the Internet.

There were also around 1,400 photos in his mobile phone, including photos that Wong took of himself, his friends and his partners. Wong kept all these materials for his personal consumption and did not display or transmit them to others, said the prosecution.

The prosecutor sought a fine of S$42,000 to S$42,500, while the defence asked for a fine of not more than S$27,500.

The defence contended that the criminal proceedings had caused Wong mental anguish and affected his career prospects.

The court heard that Wong is now a container prime mover driver. He had identified himself as a political and business intelligence analyst in the Nikkei Asia piece.

The judge rejected this argument, making reference to an opinion piece for TODAY in which Wong described his new career as a blue-collar worker as ""fulfilling and productive"". He added that any impact to Wong's career was a natural consequence of his own actions. He also disagreed that negative media coverage was a mitigating factor when deciding on sentence.

The judge agreed that Wong's offences did not warrant a jail term as he had kept the obscene materials for his own consumption.

Wong is the last of four men, all members of the Telegram chat group, to be dealt with.

His three co-accused Tan Yeow Chong, Lincoln Anthony Fernandez and Yee Wing Kay were earlier jailed and fined.",0
"Man jailed for falsifying course records to cheat more than S$72,000 in training grants","SINGAPORE: A trainer was sentenced to 20 weeks’ jail on Friday (Apr 8) for falsifying course records to cheat more than S$72,000 in training grants.

Marsh Terranova Tiruchellam, 54, was convicted on Dec 17 last year of three charges of falsifying attendance records to cheat then Workforce Development Agency (WDA) into believing that he had conducted courses, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) said in a press release. Three similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.

Marsh was a trainer at Loyal Reliance, a training provider engaged to conduct courses for employees of Yoke Mah Plasterceil.

Between July 2014 and November 2014, he falsified six attendance records, which showed that employees of Yoke Mah Plasterceil had attained full attendance for courses, although he did not conduct them.

He is the last of five individuals sentenced for this case, said SSG. The four others were sentenced to jail terms ranging from 11 weeks to 29 months, said SSG.

The agency added that it takes a “serious view of any individual or organisation that defrauds or abuses SSG funding”. “Their actions undermine the work of many others who dedicate their career and businesses to delivering proper, high quality adult education to Singaporeans,” said SSG, adding that it will not hesitate to take action against those found contravening its funding terms and conditions.",0
Jail for man who threw wine bottle that killed 73-year-old man in act of 'religious hostility',"SINGAPORE: A man who threw a wine bottle at a group of people from two floors above, striking and killing a 73-year-old man, was sentenced to five years and six months' jail on Friday (Apr 8).

Andrew Gosling, 49, told police that he wanted to startle the group, who were from the Malay-Muslim community. He pleaded guilty in February to two charges of causing death by a rash act and causing grievous hurt by a rash act. Principal District Judge Victor Yeo said Gosling's actions could be viewed as demonstrating ""religious hostility"" towards the group and that he must be firmly dealt with.

He was sentenced to four years' jail for causing death by a rash act, and one year and six months' jail for causing grievous hurt by a rash act. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively. THE INCIDENT
On Aug 18, 2019, Gosling, an Australian national, drank beer with an acquaintance at lunch, before having two more bottles of beer at dinner. He drank another can of beer when he reached his apartment on the seventh floor of Spottiswoode 18 condominium in Tanjong Pagar.

The group was having a barbecue by the swimming pool on the fifth floor of the condominium. Gosling identified them as being from the Malay-Muslim community, as there were women wearing headscarves, the court heard previously. The elderly victim was part of the group.

Sometime after 8pm, he went to the rubbish chute at the lift lobby of the seventh floor, where he found an empty wine bottle about 30cm long.
Gosling threw the bottle at the group from the seventh floor. He also shouted religiously charged vulgarities before running back to his apartment.

The bottle struck the victim on his head, before ricocheting and hitting his wife on the shoulder.

The elderly victim collapsed to the ground and was unconscious. He suffered multiple skull fractures and extensive bleeding in his brain and died the next morning. The cause of death was determined to be head injuries.

Gosling admitted during police investigations that he had thought of using a weapon such as a gun to shoot the group, but dismissed this as a ""heinous act"".

The court had also heard that he was ""angry and upset"" at attacks committed by fundamentalist groups in Bali and Melbourne that had killed Australian citizens. Gosling was assessed by a psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health and found to have been intoxicated around the time of the offence. 

He has a past history of anxiety disorder, but no contributory link was found between his mental condition and the offence, the court heard previously.

A second report issued jointly with the defence's psychiatrist stated that Gosling was inebriated, but that the amount of alcohol was within his usual limits and not enough to remove his culpability for the offence.

The level of alcohol did contribute to the offence, the report stated, and Gosling experienced some impairment of judgment, but this did not affect his soundness of mind.

According to the report, he was prone to having ""obsessive"" negative thoughts in relation to Muslims when he was intoxicated, but this did not reflect his true feelings. ""ONLY TIME WILL HEAL THIS"": VICTIM'S SON
""Preserving and building inter-religious harmony in Singapore is sacrosanct and this could have a wider impact of causing unease among the broader Muslim community,"" said the judge.

It was necessary for the sentence imposed to dispel the unease and disquiet that could emanate from the offence, he said.

The judge also gave weight to the emotional and economic impact of Gosling's actions on the victim's wife to assess the ancillary harm caused.

The 69-year-old woman was also injured when the bottle hit her shoulder. She had been married to her husband for 45 years, and had four children with him, but was now living alone.

Before his death, the victim worked as a van driver for a delivery company and would give his wife S$600 for monthly expenses.

At an earlier hearing, the court heard that the widow felt a big loss, and even more so during the fasting month and family gatherings.

She also suffered flashbacks of the incident, the judge said.

The victim's family was present at the hearing in the State Courts on Friday. After the sentence, the victim's wife told reporters that she had no comment on the sentence and that ""it's fate"".

Her son told reporters: ""It's hard to forgive, only time will heal this.""

For causing death by a rash act, Gosling could have been jailed up to five years, fined or both. For causing grievous hurt by a rash act, he could have been jailed up to four years, fined up to S$10,000 or both.

Court records show Gosling has filed an appeal against the sentence.",0
SIA flights between Singapore and Shanghai departing Apr 11 cancelled due to Chinese city's COVID-19 lockdown,"SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced on Friday (Apr 8) that two flights between Singapore and Shanghai that are set to depart on Apr 11 have been cancelled.  

In a Facebook post, the airline said that flights SQ830 and SQ833 will not take off due to “operational constraints as a result of the regulatory lockdown measures in Shanghai”.
“SIA would like to extend our sincere apologies to the affected customers. We are reaching out to them to offer all necessary assistance and to minimise the inconvenience caused by this disruption,” said the airline.

In response to CNA's queries, an SIA spokesperson said that the operational constraints were due to a shortage of manpower required to support operations at Shanghai Pudong International Airport as a result of the lockdown measures.

The spokesperson apologised to affected customers and said the airline is offering customers ""all necessary assistance"".

Checks by CNA showed that as of 10.50am on Friday, the SIA website was not taking in bookings for the route between Singapore and Shanghai. Shanghai announced on Mar 27 that it would lock down the city in two stages to carry out COVID-19 testing over a nine-day period, after it reported a new daily record for asymptomatic infections.
The city of 26 million people, which has been battling a new coronavirus surge, recorded 2,631 new asymptomatic cases on Mar 26. This accounted for nearly 60 per cent of China's new asymptomatic cases that day.

Shanghai authorities ordered everyone to stay at home and said they would carry out COVID-19 testing in the city's eastern and western districts from Mar 28 to Apr 1 and from Apr 1 to Apr 5, respectively.

A new round of testing began after China reported more than 20,000 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday.",0

Five teens arrested for conspiring to cheat at least 25 victims in mobile phone scheme,"SINGAPORE: Five teenagers have been arrested for their suspected involvement in conspiring to cheat at least 25 victims, with the men obtaining wrongful gain of more than S$27,000. 

Police said they received nine reports between February and April 6 this year where victims were approached by the suspects to earn ""quick cash"" by subscribing to new handphone lines that came with a new mobile phone. The men had also promised to manage the monthly subscription payments, said the police in a press release on Friday (Apr 8).

The five men, aged between 16 and 18, later allegedly collected the mobile phones from the victims and sold them. They then became uncontactable.

Three men will be charged in court on Friday with the offence of cheating with conspiracy. If found guilty, they face a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. ",0

Fifteen patients are in the intensive care unit, unchanged from Wednesday.
Most of Singapore's new COVID-19 infections are Protocol 2 cases, which are those who are well or assessed to have a mild condition.

Among the new cases reported on Thursday, 3,771 are classified under Protocol 2, comprising 3,665 local cases and 106 imported infections.

Another 498 cases were confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, with 18 of them being imported infections. The week on week infection ratio is 0.73, higher than the 0.72 on Wednesday. A number below 1 indicates that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is falling.

MAS transfers S$75 billion of excess foreign reserves to Government,"SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said on Thursday (Apr 7) it has transferred excess official foreign reserves (OFR) of S$75 billion to the Government through a subscription of Reserves Management Government Securities (RMGS).

RMGS is a mechanism to facilitate the transfer of OFR that is not needed for the conduct of monetary policy and financial stability from the central bank to the Government, for longer-term investment by GIC, the sovereign wealth fund. The optimal amount of OFR that the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) estimates it needs is currently 65 per cent to 75 per cent of gross domestic product.

The MAS manages policy through exchange rate settings rather than interest rates, letting the Singapore dollar rise or fall against the currencies of its main trading partners within an undisclosed policy band, known as the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate, or S$NEER.

The stock of OFR reached S$563 billion, or about 106 per cent of GDP, at the end of 2021, reflecting the persistently strong appreciation pressures on the S$NEER from Singapore's positive net savings and large capital inflows from abroad, MAS said.

After the transfer of S$75 billion, the central bank estimated the stock of OFR remaining on its balance sheet at around 95 per cent of GDP.

It said it expects further transfers of excess OFR to the government over the course of the year to bring it to the optimal amount. ",0
